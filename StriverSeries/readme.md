_Memoization: Known as the “top-down” dynamic programming, usually the problem is solved in the direction of the main problem to the base cases._

_Tabulation: Known as the “bottom-up ” dynamic programming, usually the problem is solved in the direction of solving the base cases to the main problem_

* Do all possible ways on that index according to problem statement
* Sum of all possible ways.., Max or min of possibilities
